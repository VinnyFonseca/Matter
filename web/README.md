## What is Matter?

Matter is a **SASS** front-end framework and the result of **years** of problem solving, bug fixing, cross-browser and cross-platform testing. It went back to the basics and is designed to make HTML work **for** you, not against you.

It is built over **many iterations**, **cleanups**, **revisions** and **upgrades**, instead of a single sprint from the ground up. This process makes Matter **stable**, **tested** and with **fewer bugs**, while maintaining compatibility all the way to **IE8**.
